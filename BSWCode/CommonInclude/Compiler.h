 **              All mappings of keywords which are  not standardized and/or   **
 **              compiler specific shall be placed  and organized in this      **
 **              compiler specific header. The file is  needed to decouple     **
 **              the code of all standard core components from compiler        **
 **              topics and thus enhance portability.                          **
 **                                                                            **
